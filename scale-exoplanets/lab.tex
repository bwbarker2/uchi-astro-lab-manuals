\chapter{Scale of the solar system and local stellar environment}

%todo for proxima group, add the voyager probes and the heliopause (with info about probes, when sent, etc)

Why can't we just see planets orbiting other stars with normal observational techniques like looking through larger and larger telescopes? Through this lab, we hope you gain a felt sense appreciation for the scale of star systems and the distance between the Sun and our closest stellar neighbor, and see why we need to use special techniques to detect exoplanets.

\section{Forming Groups}

\begin{steps}
	\item Fill out the group introductions spreadsheet found here: \url{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L1_1tgeTgnK4dscQ3UtcFngSb-Tn77G_kfv2j9CyZxY/edit?usp=sharing}, including taking the DOPE Bird Personality Quiz, linked to in the spreadsheet.
	
	\item Contact others in your lab section to form groups. Consider what kind of Bird Types you think would add to your group's effectiveness, and also what time zone people are in and when they are generally available to work.
\end{steps}

If you are attending the lab session live and do not yet have a group, one way the TA could assist is to arrange "speed networking" among those who still need a group. This would involve the TA organizing Zoom Breakout Rooms, where each room is 2-3 students, and each group talks about how they work and what they are looking for in a group member. Then after 5 minutes or so, the Rooms are changed so people are with different people. This could help people get to know each other enough to form lab groups.

\begin{steps}
	\item Once you have a group, meet with each other and decide a) what tools you will use to communicate and collaborate, b) when you will meet, c) what you will do when you need to change an agreement, and d) what you will do when you a person has an issue with how the group is functioning. \textbf{Write this in your lab report. This part counts as data collection and analysis, so it can be identical in each member's report.}
\end{steps}

\section{Your current intuition}\label{se:sec:intuition}

In order to gauge your current sense of where things are in relation to each other, each member of your group will first make three different small, qualitative scale models. \textbf{For this section, do not use a book, or the Internet, other people, or any other resource, to guide your efforts.} This will help you see where your current intuition lies. And when you compare to others, do not change your guess --- it is expected that you might not have an accurate conception yet.

\begin{steps}
	\item Individually, without looking at your groupmates' work, take a blank sheet of paper and draw a horizontal line across the page. On the left end of it, place a dot and mark it ``Sun''. On the right end, place a dot and mark it ``Neptune''. Now place and label a dot for your best guess of the orbital distance for each of the seven other planets orbiting the Sun.

	\item Next, make a similar scale model, this time placing the following objects on it: the Sun, Neptune, our nearest star Proxima Centauri, and its planet, Proxima Centauri b.
	
	\item Finally, draw the Sun and all 8 planets with your best guess of their relative sizes --- you should end up with 9 circles. The distances do not need to be scaled as well for this estimate.

	\item Compare your drawings with your groupmates. Write down any surprises or big differences that you had for your report.
\end{steps}

\section{Making an accurate scale model}\label{se:sec:model}

Now that you have your current sense of it, you will make accurate scale models of the three scales you made above. Bigger is better, so 
%you will use the hallway that extends on the second floor from the south end of Kersten, across the skywalk, through Eckhardt, and into the Accelerator Building.
feel free to get creative in finding a long distance you can work from to make your scale. Only go outside to do so if you are confident you won't increase your risk.

%\textbf{Available equipment:} measuring wheel
\textbf{Possible equipment:} paper, masking or label tape, scissors, markers

%Your group will be assigned one of the 3 scale models described in the previous section to create in the hallway. After you create it, you will make a short ($\sim 5\:$min) video presentation and upload it to a Canvas Discussion, describing what you found and what your impression is, and walking the class through the scale model that you made down the hallway.

\subsection{Tips}
\begin{itemize}
	\item To make a scale model, you will need to gather the size or distance information for the objects in your model using any resource you'd like, then divide each of those by the same number to create your scale. You can use a spreadsheet to make this task easier.
	
	\item For the two distance scale models, you will need to measure the distance you have to work with.% in the hallway.
	Ensure that you can see from one end to the other.
	%Prop open the skywalk doors if needed.
	You should place some kind of upright sign, perhaps taped down, at each spot where an object is in your model.
	
	\item For the size scale model, since all the objects are mostly spherical, you can create your model by cutting out circles of paper. For the larger objects, feel free to tape sheets of paper together to make a bigger circle.
\end{itemize}

\begin{steps}
	\item Make a table of the real distances and sizes and your scaled down versions. \textbf{Include this in your report.}
	
	\item Document your scale model with pictures and/or video (you can upload your video somewhere and include a link in your lab report).
\end{steps}

\section{Appreciating distances}\label{se:sec:calc}

Answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Using a nominal speed of a car on Earth, how long would it take to drive:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item once around the equator?
		\item from the Earth to the Sun?
		\item from the Sun to Neptune?
		\item from the Sun to Proxima Centauri?
	\end{enumerate}
	\item If you wanted to travel each of these distances in 1 year, how fast would you need to go in each case?
	\item For the longest distance, how does that speed compare to the speed of light, which is the fastest anything can go?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Report checklist}

Include the following in your lab report. See Appendix~\ref{cha:lab-report-format} for formatting details.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Your intuition estimates from Section~\ref{se:sec:intuition} and your reflection of how they compare to your group mates'.
	\item A table of the distances/sizes and scaled version that you created in Section~\ref{se:sec:model}.
	\item Pictures or video of your scale model.
	\item Worked solutions to the questions in Section~\ref{se:sec:calc}.
	\item A 100--200 word reflection on the scale --- was there anything that surprised you? How do you see your place in the universe, given the scale of the solar system and how far away even the nearest star is?
	\item A 100--200 word reflection on group dynamics and feedback on the lab manual. Address the following topics: who did what in the lab, how did you work together, what successes and challenges in group functioning did you have, and what would you keep and change about the lab write-up?
\end{enumerate}
