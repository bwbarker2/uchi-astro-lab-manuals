\chapter{Rubrics}\label{cha:rubrics}

%Each lab is graded 50\% on attendance and participation during the lab, and providing evidence in the lab report of completing all steps of the lab, including answering every question. The other 50\% is based on a selection of scientific abilities.

%Each scientific ability rubric row assessed is worth a possible 1 point, with ``Missing'' being 0 points, ``Inadequate'' 1/3 points, ``Needs Improvement'' 2/3 points, and ``Adequate'' 1 point.

The scientific abilities rubrics are found on the following pages.
